-IMMERSIVE WATER-
v3
By Chai Latte

Setup Instructions:
1. Import VRCSDK, Standard Assets, Toybox, and Post Processing Stack to your project. 
2. Set up VRC layers using the VRC Control Panel.
3. Create a new layer in Slot 22 and call it PlayerTracking.
4. Import the Immersive Water package. 
5. Drag the scene (if you're a beginner) or prefab (if you're more comfortable experimenting) into your project. 

Notes: 
If you would like to use your own VRCWorld, make sure you have your main camera set as the reference camera.

If you would like to use your own main camera, make sure you copy over the Post Process Layer component from the scene's main camera.
